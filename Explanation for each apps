Customer
Customers can see every product with its price and picture.Each product has an "Add To Cart" button next to it. 
Customers can put items they want in their cart by clicking this button. Every click updates the cart showing the item's name and price in the "Cart" section. 
The cart shows the total price of every order a customer makes. Customers can check their selections in the cart section.
If they want to start over, they can click the "Cancel" button. This empties the cart and resets the total price to zero. 
When customers are happy with what they've picked, they can place their order by clicking "Submit Order."
This brings up a box asking for their name. If they type in a name, the system sends their order to a PHP script on the server.
This order has a unique order ID, the number of items bought, and the total price. 
If everything looks good and the customer sends the order, they'll see a message saying it worked, and the Order ID box displays the new ID number. 
But if something doesn't go as planned, the system will show a message telling the customer the order wasn't successful.
