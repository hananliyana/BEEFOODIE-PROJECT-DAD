In our gorup project we forms a database known as groupprojectdad and then populates it with one table, itemorder, which keeps information regarding item orders. 
The itemorder table has five columns: Order_ID (a primary key), Name, Quantity, Price and the ‘Status’ column that takes its default value to be 'incomplete'.
